YCH’s R&D facility houses one of the only labs in the world with the capability to analyze previously undetectable aromatic components, allowing the identification of those with the greatest potential of showing up in finished beers. This blend of Cryo Hops® pellets contains hop varieties that are loaded with beer-soluble compounds that survive harsh brewing processes including heat, fermentation and CO2 scrubbing. By maximizing concentrations of the most impactful and complementary hop compounds, we offer an incredibly powerful hop pellet that creates a true ‘pop’ of aromas in beers.
